# Neuro-Evolution
Custom implementation of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies.

Based on the work of Kenneth Stanley [[1]](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.cec02.pdf)


## Disclaimer:

As of writing this README.md (5/9/2023), this library does not implement protecting innovation through speciations.
This is a fundamental concept introduced by Stanley, as it gives newly mutated genomes time to optimize their architectures
